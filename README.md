This GitHub Repository hosts the all of the code and data sources used
for both projects conducted during my Spring Semester as Bellevue University
while pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science, specifically for the class - Applied Data Science. 

It should be noted that there are only two projects in this repository (the ones for this specific class), 
as I did not originally upload my works to GitHub throughout the entirety of my time in the program.
Additionally, since first beginning the program I have cycled through a few computers and have lost most of my previous works.

Although this repository contains all of the technical data and code associated with my projects to include final powerpoint presentations,
my final portfolio and works can be found here: https://gonzalezk92.wixsite.com/portfolio

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ******
It is important to note that both this repository and the above linked portfolio are strictly for the completion of the assignment, as it is no longer this student's intention to pursue a career change to Data Science.
