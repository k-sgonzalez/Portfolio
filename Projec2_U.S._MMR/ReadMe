PROPOSAL: Maternal Mortality: How does the U.S. compare against the rest of the world?

TOPIC: This project aims at examining maternal mortality rates globally and in the U.S., 
in an attempt to determine how the U.S. stacks against the rest of the world. Other factors examined are cause of 
maternal death, geographic region, attendance of skilled birth professional, accessibility to antenatal care.

BUSINESS PROBLEM: According to an article published by the commonwealthfund.org, 
“Most maternal deaths are preventable, but they have been increasing in the United States. 
Other high-income countries with success in preventing maternal deaths offer potential lessons for the U.S.” (Roosa Tikkanen, 2020)
